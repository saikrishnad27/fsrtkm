project2:
I have watched this youtube video to understand about how to establish server and client communication:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudT0nHvkkE
the related github code to this youtube video: https://github.com/tech-with-moss/go-usermgmt-grpc
I have used the hash code which is given in the project Description
I have understood about the mutexes in go by using the link given by professor
As it was given non persistent collection I have used map to store the values and refered this link to understand the concept https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/golang-program-that-uses-structs-as-map-keys/
I have read all the links which are mentioned in the question document to understand topics and built my code.


project 3:
along with these references i have also used this link to know how to read from yaml file
https://zetcode.com/golang/yaml/ ("for the code in func init of server and client i used this)

and the algorithm for read and write operation was completely based on the book intro to reliable and secure distributed programming
